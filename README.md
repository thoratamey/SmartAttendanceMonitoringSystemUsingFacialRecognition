# Smart Attendance Monitoring System Using Facial Recognition
It is the MTECH Project using ML,DL and IP.

For Demo Video of Project visit the Project Page in Portfolio : https://thoratamey1210.wixsite.com/portfolio
## Dataset

## Step for Implementing Project
### Step 1:
Run the Project3.ipynb from Final Model Building Folder with the given the dataset above

File of FaceNet Model and KNN model (pickle) will be created
### Step 2:
Connect the KNN pickle file with application present from FRAS Folder 

In that edit the path of file and folder present in app.py
### Step 3:
Run the app.py after editing all path in it.
## Remaining Folder
As it is MTECH Project the literature survey is done, the paper which are reviewed are in Reference Paper Folder

All the Documentations done for review are in Written Paper + ... Folder
